Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
2. IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
3. LoadBalancer does not have HTTP -> HTTPS redirection.
4. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets.
5. TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance.
6. The use of a non-root account is not enforced.
7. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
2. Create a CloudTrail which is stored on S3.
3. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
4. Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging
5. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
6. Set IAM policies for not allowing root user and to enforce MFA, as well as the specific permissions.
